# Jo Shinonome

I work as a data engineer and quant developer.

I'm interested in solving low latency problems, improving performance and designing user-friendly APIs.

I greatly enjoy using `Rust`.

I currently focus on building VSCode plugins and implementing features for `jasmine`.

## Open Source Projects

- [vscode-q](https://github.com/jshinonome/vscode-q), a VSCode extension for `q`. However, it is in maintenance mode. The q code parser is not open-sourced.
- [geek](https://github.com/jshinonome/geek), a `Go` interface to `q`
- [kola](https://github.com/jshinonome/kola), a `Rust`/`Python` interface to `q`
- [jkdb](https://github.com/jshinonome/jkdb), a modern and high performance `JavaScript` interface to `q`
- [kuki](https://github.com/jshinonome/kuki), a `q` package manager

## Other Projects

- vscode-jasmine, a VSCode extension for `jasmine`
- vscode-q-pro, a VSCode extension for `q` with professional features
- qrs, a Rust FFI binding to `q`, easily to develop `q` functions in `Rust`
